# Cool Guy Text Processing
"Cool Guy Text Processing" is a small-ish filestream tool that does language syntax-restrained text processing. Made to support the future project "Cool Guy Dumper".

# Development
The project is in early development, which is handled by @cristeigabriel. Contributions are welcome though, through the Pull Request page. Design is subject to possible change as mentioned below.

# Customization
The customization allowed for is viewable in the "stream.h" file, at the beginning, working as preprocessors. This may not be ideal, but the codebase developed alongside with this design. With time, if considered as needed, this might change.

# Limitations
To avoid useless overhead, the project allows for the creation of illegal expressions/code, nonetheless there's a clear design in mind for every feature which you should be respecting if you use this project. This may change with time.

Limitations are to be, in the future, if needed, handled as logical errors, so this *might* break compability with some code, if you're generating illegal expressions/code.

# Examples of usage
Check the "output" file.

# Support
The project has custom implementations of text processing for the C and C++ language, the ones being officially supported.

# Licensing
"Cool Guy Text Processing" is licensed under the GPL (v2) license.
